      Three o'clock in the afternoon is a mysterious time, and I often prepare to attend afternoon classes at this time. Sometimes the teacher would ask us to go to the Met or other museums, which is why I discovered something - the New York subway is particularly crowded at three o'clock. I can't help but wonder why this is happening? Perhaps there are many people like me who go to museums, as well as many who have already finished work and are rushing home.
      <br><br>
      The subway station at this time is really lively, making me feel like all kinds of people are gathering here, and everyone has something to do.
